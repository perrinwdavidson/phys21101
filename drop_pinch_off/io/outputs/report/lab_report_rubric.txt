## Lab report rubric
- Details on sample preparation if you made your own samples.
- A description of the different power law relationships you were able to come up with and an interpretation of why they seem like reasonable descriptions of the pinch off process.
- Plots of the data showing different power law regimes.
- How you determined minimum neck radii.
- How you calibrated the image scale.
- How you assessed, quantified and propagated uncertainties should be discussed and made clear including examples of how calculations were done where appropriate.
- How you arrived at the different power law relationships.
- How your observations of the behavior of the drop in each regime makes sense in terms of the dominant physical parameters in play.
- Presents plots of data as needed and uses them to support the narrative of the report.
- Properly labels plots, and makes presentation clean and clear.
- Uses error bars where appropriate.
- Includes captions that provide appropriate context.
- Presents all numerical values with appropriate units and significant figures.
- Clearly formats numbers, equations, tables, etc.
- Describes how the raw data was processed including with uncertainties. 
- Details fit functions and provides sample fits (if appropriate). 
- Details other calculations/considerations and provides sample calculations or reasoning (if appropriate).
- Identifies relevant sources of uncertainty in measured quantities, and quantifies values when possible. 
- Describes how uncertainties were assessed and incorporated into the analysis. 
- Identifies potential sources of systematic bias and describes how they are accounted for in the analysis or eliminated.
- Final results are presented clearly. 
- Data tables and plots are used where appropriate and are properly labeled and annotated. 
- Measured and calculated quantities include units and uncertainties where appropriate.
- Makes clear final conclusions that are fully supported by the experimental results and discusses the overall take-aways of the experiment appropriately. 
- Properly accounts for or contextualizes measurement uncertainties and potential sources of systematic bias.
